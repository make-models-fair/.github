# Make 100+ Models FAIR

Welcome to the Making 100+ Models FAIR initiative. The goal of this initiative is to provide capacity-building opportunities to improve the skill, practices, and protocols to make computational models more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We have selected a list of highly cited papers in different domains and a protocol for making the models referenced in this publications FAIR. We will also stimulate activities that advance model analysis of these FAIR models using high throughput computing on the [Open Science Grid](https://osg-htc.org/).
